# DCarbon Program

DCarbon is a blockchain-based solution designed to tackle carbon emissions through a decentralized approach. The project aims to incentivize carbon reduction by providing a transparent and trustless platform for tracking and trading carbon credits.

Below is the initial structuring of the DCarbon project repository with the first commit details.

## Repository Structure

- `migrations/`: Contains database migration files.
- `programs/dcarbon-program/`: Houses the core logic for the DCarbon blockchain program.
- `tests/`: Includes tests for validating the functionality of the DCarbon program.
- `.env_txt`: Placeholder for environment variables required for the project.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies untracked files that Git should ignore.
- `Anchor.toml`: Configuration file for Anchor, a framework for Solana's Sealevel runtime providing several conveniences for developing Solana programs.
- `Cargo.lock`: Autogenerated file ensuring a consistent build by locking dependencies to specific versions.
- `Cargo.toml`: Manifest file for Rust, specifying package information and dependencies.
- `package.json`: Lists the dependencies and scripts for Node.js necessary for the project.
- `tsconfig.json`: Configuration file for Typescript compiler options.

## Getting Started

To get started with the DCarbon program, please follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

- Install Rust programming language: [https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Install Node.js and npm: [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
- Install Anchor framework: [https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html](https://project-serum.github.io/anchor/getting-started/installation.html)

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/dcarbon.git
cd carbon
```

2. Install JavaScript dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```
3. Build the program:
```sh
anchor build
```
4. Test the program:
```sh
anchor test
```
### Configuration
- Copy .env_txt to .env and fill in the required environment variables:
```sh
cp .env_txt .env
# Edit the .env file with your environment-specific values
```
### Running the Program
- After setting up and testing, you can deploy the program to a localnet, devnet, or mainnet-beta (assuming you have the Solana CLI installed):
```sh
solana program deploy /path/to/your/compiled/program.so
```
